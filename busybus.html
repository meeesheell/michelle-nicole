            <p>
              When a local city starts to expand its public transportation bus routes, many times there are growing pains. For this expansion, our local city is running into a few problems and would like them resolved by creating an application. Our
              role is to create BusyBus, a project that the local city transit system is working on for all commuters in a town near you.

              Numerous bus routes have been added and many of those routes stop at the same bus stop. Riders are currently complaining the about the bus stop at Washington & State, which have 7 bus lines serving the stop.

              The goal is to work with the local city to create an interface application that easily helps riders know what the next arriving bus is, and how much time they have to get to the bus stop. We created BusyBus, an application to help
              riders know what the next arriving bus is and how much time they have to get to the bus stop.

              <h3>Understanding our Target Market</h3>
              <p>I conducted a survey on a new proposed app, called BusyBus, and over a 48 hour time span with a total of 21 respondents. Of the people who were surveyed, 100% of the respondents have taken some form of public transportation. I needed
                to learn:</p>

              <p>I ran a competitive analysis so that we understand the current transporatiton applicaitons in major metroplolitan areas. With a huge variety of applications that are currently out there, how could we make BusyBus stand out?</p>
              <p>I did research on two different applications, one that 71% of my respondents prefer using: Google Maps, and then another application I was not familiar with but wanted to learn more about: Citymapper.</p>
              <p>From this competitive analysis, I learned to create an application with a blend of both, focused on the local public transit bus system’s real time data and with great navigation. If possible, add in Augmented Reality!</p>

                Google is a widely known company, and Google Maps looks clean with clearly defined streets, highways, establishments with map details: Transit, Traffic, Biking</p>

              <p><b class="subcategory">Weakness</b><br>

                Walking directions can be tough when Wifi or cell phone data is low.</p>
              <p>When figuring out where to travel to, the mode of travel is a swipe left or right - sometimes it’s hard to realize what mode of travel you’re on (car or train) until you look at the directions</p>

              <p><b class="subcategory">Opportunities</b><br>

                Brand: Google is one of the top, if not top widely known brand around the world and Google Maps is offered in 220 different countries so it’s helpful for travelers going from city to city and alleviates the pain of having to go from a
                different application system.</p>


              <p><b class="subcategory">Threats</b><br>

                When using an iPhone, Apple Maps comes with it, so Google Maps is not dominant.
                App can be more proficient with subway and public transportation.

                You can select your mode of navigation through a toolbar - Maps, Bus, Muni, Bart, Lines, Rail, Bike, Scooter, Moped and more. Includes detailed public transportation info like timetables of a specific bus route, times you need to be

              <p><b class="subcategory">Weaknesses</b><br>

                Does not show driving GPS and navigation, and is not offered in all citiies.</p>

            <h3>A three screen sketch prototype approach</h3>
            <p>I created this three screen prototype of BusyBus, a project that the local city transit system is working on for all commuters in a town near you. I needed to create an app that helped riders know when the next arriving bus is and how
              much time they have to get to the bus stop.</p>
            <p>My thoughts to create these sketches are going to be described going from Screen #1 to Screen #3, which is from Left to Right. This is my BusyBus Three Screen Sketch Prototype that I created based off my User Survey, Competitive
              Analysis, and User Stories.</p>

            <h3>User Testing on Maze</h3>
            <p>I needed to test these screens to see if they were working as intended. In order to do so, I uploaded sketches to Marvel, and imported them to Maze.
              Then, ran 4 tests to see if users would understand where to navigate.
              With their screenshots below, heatmaps are shown where the user tapped and wanted to go. I asked users to: <h5>Take me to my destination in the least amount of time.</h5>
            </p>
            <p>Based on the results, the user tests’ time varied between 9.8 seconds to 52.53 seconds, and I found:</p>
            <p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  <h5> • 25 % of the users were able to go through the app efficiently without any misclicks</h5>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h5> • 50% of the users selected a bus on the first try to go to the last screen</h5>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <h5> • 75% of users selected the “search” toolbar eventually to get to the next screen</h5>

      </div>

      <div class="sectionmiddle paragraph">
        <p>Throughout the visual design of BusyBus, I knew I wanted to keep the BusyBus app clean, simple, and light.</p>
        <p>From the paper sketch prototype, I used Figma to create a visual design and high fidelity mockups based off my sketch, shown in the middle. I created the BusyBus and the next arriving bus icon, and used the iOS location icon for the rest.
          After adding the icons in, the screen looked too repetitive, and literally, busy.
        </p>
        <img src="/images/busybus/BusyBus_IconLibrary.png" width=100% alt="">

        <p>For the next high fidelity mockup and final design:
          <p>• I removed the bus icon, and enlarged the bus number (I was bummed I wasn’t going to use my handmade bus icon)</p>
          <p>• Removed the top navigational piece as it was not needed (initially from doing my competitive analysis, I thought doing a navigational piece was a great add on, but from the client, it was not). So I removed it to not introduce scope
            creep</p>
          <p>• Removed the next arriving bus icon</p>
          <p>• The large blocks of numbers on the left hand side were too close together, so the minutes got moved to the right while the bus number remained </p>
          <p>• The right hand alignment was hard to read for the buses, so it moved to the middle and was left aligned</p>

          <p>After a few iterations, the final visual design of the the app is a light gray, and I added a pop of color for the bus numbers in purple. The bus information is in SF Pro Display and arrival time in SF Pro text, and are in different
            sizes, weights, and colors to show visual heiarchy.</p>

          <p>The final high fidelity mockup now helps riders know what the next arriving bus is by displaying the bus number (on the left), how much time they have to get to the next bus stop by including its frequency (in the middle), and how long
            the bus ride will take (on the right). </p>

            <p>When implementing the frontend HTML & CSS, we were provided with the correct bus numbers, names of the bus routes, direction the buses are going in, frequency, and even outages. I removed the “BUS” above the bus number to remove
              redundancies, left aligned the bus number, but kept its color purple. For out of service buses, I highlighted them in red and changed their duration to 0 minutes to alert riders.</p>

            <p>What I learned the most from this BusyBus case study was visual heiarchy, frontend HTML & CSS, and learning how to keep your designs simple. For coding, I learned how to create objects within CSS, and how much alignment is important.
              On my frontend development, I do have a hover over state, but since this is a mobile app, users will not enjoy this feature.</p>

            <p>If I had more time, I would continue building these additional screens and code them.</p>
