              At the start of COVID-19, depending on where you reside, “shelter-in-place” was ordered to help #flattenthecurve. Many people are now working from home and those who normally get coffee on the way to work, or at work, now have to make
              coffee at home.

              Who knows what our lives might be like after this pandemic, but we might be better baristas by the end of this. Sip is a recipe and educational video content site that educates people how to make particular drinks at home. Currently,
              starting with coffee, it teaches people who drink coffee the history, the method, and recipes. AR Barista Mate also helps people easily overcome pouring various drink ratios.
              <br><br>Also, “sip” means “to drink (a liquid) a little at a time; take small tastes of”, but it is also serves as a double entendre for the acronym, “Shelter In Place.”

              <p>I wanted to understand coffee lovers coffee habits, so to learn about our target market, I sent out a survey and interviewed some respondents. For the first survey, I didn’t find a clear direction or trend that stood out from the

              <p>I ran a competitive analysis so that we understand our target market and competition. Since we were still brand new in figuring out what type of coffee site or app, we looked at a few leaders in the coffee industry. I chose three
                different companies: Starbucks, Blue Bottle, and Stumptown Roasteries to understand what they are doing well, and what problems could improve on.

              <h5>Blue Bottle Coffee</h5>
              <p>A third world coffee culture company that focuses their coffee to “Taste like it was ground moments ago”.</p>

              <p><b class="subcategory">Strengths</b><br>

                A large West Coast fan base & following - in addition to serving beans at peak flavor, they will also have “a good conversation and friendly advice”. Due to COVID-19, they are not making any changes to their baristas and staff. All
                their staff will be paid for their scheduled hours.</p>
              <p><b class="subcategory">Weaknesses</b><br>

                Their drip/pour over coffee takes longer to brew if in a rush - and their line could get pretty long.</p>

              <p><b class="subcategory">Opportunities</b><br>

                They have their monthly subscription program, which keeps customers continuously purchasing their coffee, and knowing how much they should be targeting for roasting. Provide Brew guides online and still delivering coffee during
                COVID-19.</p>

              <p><b class="subcategory">Threats</b><br>

                Blue Bottle was able to break through and gain an entirely specific target market with customers who love the freshness of their coffee.</p>

              <h5>Stumptown</h5>
              <p>Another third world coffee culture company that pays 3-4x fair trade price and received numerous awards for their beans.</p>

              <p><b class="subcategory">Strengths</b><br>
                “They want to help farms become sustainable and to set up strong businesses that build up their communities and produce the highest-quality coffee possible year after year.”</p>

              <p><b class="subcategory">Weaknesses</b><br>
                As a new customer, it was hard to learn and understand their beans. It was hard to figure out which beans to purchase - they don’t have a quiz to help you find beans. It was only until later I found their Tasting Guide as a link to
                their blog from their FAQ, and they seem to have mostly medium roast beans.</p>

              <p><b class="subcategory">Opportunities</b><br>
                They do direct trade, meaning they purchase directly from their “producers”. They also have a lot of oat milk drinks, which is popular.</p>

              <p><b class="subcategory">Threats</b><br>
                Since they share their producers, how could a competitor come about and also visit the same?</p>

      <p>With this site starting during COVID-19, I thought about verbs that relate to the way you would consume a drink. One of the verbs, “sip” meaning to drink something by taking small mouthfuls, or like the first thing you do when you drink your
        coffee, also has a double entendre as an acronym for “Shelter-in-Place” during COVID-19. </p>
      <p>From there, I was determined to make the title of this application “Sip”. “Sip at Home”, “Sip Away”, "Sip Sip hooray!" were also considered as an extension of the "Sip" title.</p>

      <h4>Sip, sip, hooray!</h4>
    </section>

    <!-- TYPOGRAPHY & LOGO-->

    <section class="projectnewsection sectioncentered">
      <h3>Typography & The Sip Logo</h3>
      <p>I ran through scripts, sans-serifs, and serif fonts, and I even envisioned that liquid would run behind the words “sip” if that was the logo. For the colors, I wasn’t sure I want to use this color brown, but I created different gradients,
        lines, and waves.</p>
      <p>With a set of logos that could be good contenders, I ran a preference test in Usability Hub and with the logo to collect votes on which logo users liked the most. With 38% of a vote amongst 7 logos, I went with what users preferred the most,
        the coffee icon with a bold font in Inter.</p>
      <p>Later, when putting together my high fidelity mockups, I began to realize the brown logo didn’t have the contrast to “pop”, so I looked for the best hue of orange. I picked orange because it’s a combination of red (which means energy, and
        coffee gives you energy!) and yellow (which means happiness, coffee makes you happy, too!).</p>

      <h3>Style Guide</h3>
      <p>The Style Guide is created to share the direction of styling for the new site, Sip, and helps with passing information down to the developers and the rest of the team who will be working on it.</p>

      <p>I want the site to look clean, colorful, but a pop of color to be bright, and gender-neutral. I chose the color orange, because it's a combination of red (energy), and yellow (happy). I picked out the typeface sans-serif Inter, and used
        different weights to show heiarchy.</p>

      <p>Creating the style guide helped turn the wireframes into higher fidelity screens.</p>

            <p>While I was building my high fidelity mockups, I ran some design blocks, so I chose to do some Preference A/B testing to see what users preferred seeing. I asked for feedback on the shape of the frame of the video, the background color
              of the AR Barista Mate badge, and whether the navigation bar should have a background color. With these results, I continued to put together the high fidelity mockups.</p>

            <h4>Based on the feedback from usability testing, and testing via Maze, here are the revisions that were made to Sip:
            </h4>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <h5>• Include a “play” button for videos so theres a signifier that these are videos, because my users were not sure if these were just pictures, or if it was clickable.</h5>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <h5>• Change the color of the AR Barista Mate Badge from white to orange.</h5>
                  <p>Even though I did a Preference A/B test for the AR Barista Mate badge, I decided to change the badge to orange so it would be noticeable and users wouldn’t miss it.
                  </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <h5>• Adjusting the ‘filter’ button from an “orange” to “gray” to indicate something has changed from the off-state and filter options and the “on-state” where the filters are visible.</h5>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <h5>• Create an extra ‘about’ page for AR Barista Mate and add it to the Navigation Bar. </h5>
                  <p>AR Barista Mate was created because users have issues figuring out the right ratios to use when making their coffee. I made this ‘about’ page to help users understand the features and how to use AR Barista Mate.
                  </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                  <h5>• Create a Mobile version so AR Barista Mate works.</h5>
                  <p>When people cook and make coffee in the kitchen, what do people typically bring with them? I felt it was necessary to create a mobile version.

              <h3>AR Barista Mate</h3>
              <p>AR Barista Mate is an interactive experience through augmented reality, which is activated through your mobile device’s camera app to help users overcome knowing what ratios to use when making a particular recipe (ie for a
                cappuccino, how much espresso : milk : foam) to use. When finishing these designs, I ran across this usability question to those who use AR Barista Mate:
                <h5>How do you manage pouring coffee with holding the phone?</h5>
              </p>
              <a href="images/sip/Sip-refinement.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="preftestingimg" src="images/sip/Sip-refinement.jpg" alt=""></a>
              <p>Good question. How do my users feel when pouring coffee while holding the phone? Are they coordinated? Are they frustrated? What are they doing? With that in mind, I went back to the research phase, deployed a survey, I asked users
                1:1 for their thoughts, and performed 2 more usability tests.</p>
              <p>
                <h5>Based on the feedback, here's what I found:</h5>
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <p>1. Over 50% of users would still hold their phones and pour their coffee ratios one handed and wouldn’t find it a nuisance.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>2. Some users would put their phone down, and then pick back up to re-measure, so I added a lock and unlock screen to AR Barista Mate.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <p>3. Some users thought it was “cool”, “fun”, and “intersting” and wanted to take a photo of their finished product, so I added an option to take a photo when complete.</p>
                </li>

          <p>In conclusion, going into this project with an array of all sorts of opportunities and UX issues to resolve, I am happy Sip was created.</p>

          <p>What surprised me the most were adding small UI adjustments to change user's behavior. Adding a “play button” next to a timestamp helped signify a "photo" was a video preview, and adjusting a drop down button instantly adjusted the
            intended behavior for a user. In addition, doing further research for AR Barista Mate and understanding the user’s experience beyond the site.</p>

          <p>Some of the most challenging parts were analyzing the user's feedback and gauging which feedback I would use to shift my design. I wanted to adjust the design from all of their feedback, but given the time constraints, I met the
            fulfillments for tthe MVP and kept the remaining adjustments for the next versions.
          </p>

          <p>If I had more time, I would have done more usability tests on this new version - both the mobile and desktop version. I would also go back and do more user research on AR Barista Mate to ensure if these adjustments resolve the real
            issues we initially had.</p>

          <p>In the future, I would like to do more user testing at different phases of a project. Rather than shipping it off to the engineer, if there was additional time, I would like to return to refine and further develop.</p>

          <p>I hope you enjoyed this case study!</p>
